  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Insert Date]<br>
  <strong>Policy Owner:</strong> Human Resources Department<br>
  <strong>Applies To:</strong> All full-time and part-time employees of [Your Company Name]</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
    <p>This policy outlines the various types of leave available to employees, the conditions under which leave may be taken, and the procedures for requesting and approving leave.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>2. Types of Leave</h2>

    <h3>2.1. Casual Leave</h3>
    <p>Employees are entitled to 8 days of casual leave per year. Casual leave can be taken for personal reasons, emergencies, or short-term needs. Casual leave requests must be submitted and approved by the immediate manager in advance, unless there is an emergency. Casual leave cannot be carried over to the following year.</p>

    <h3>2.2. Earned Leave (Annual Leave)</h3>
    <p>Employees accumulate 1.25 days of earned leave per month, totaling 15 days annually. Earned leave is generally used for vacations or personal time off. Up to 5 days of earned leave can be carried over to the next year. Any additional unused days beyond this limit will be forfeited unless otherwise specified by the company policy.</p>

    <h3>2.3. Sick Leave</h3>
    <p>Employees are entitled to 10 days of sick leave per year. Sick leave can be used when an employee is unable to work due to illness or medical reasons. A medical certificate is required if the absence exceeds 2 consecutive days. Unused sick leave cannot be carried over to the next year.</p>

    <h3>2.4. Maternity Leave</h3>
    <p>Eligible female employees are entitled to 26 weeks of maternity leave with full pay. Employees must have completed at least 6 months of continuous service. Employees must notify HR at least 8 weeks prior to the expected delivery date.</p>

    <h3>2.5. Paternity Leave</h3>
    <p>Eligible male employees are entitled to 10 working days of paternity leave within 3 months of the child's birth. Paternity leave requests should be submitted at least 2 weeks in advance.</p>

    <h3>2.6. Bereavement Leave</h3>
    <p>Employees are entitled to 3 days of paid leave in the event of a death in the immediate family (spouse, children, parents, siblings). Employees must inform HR as soon as possible regarding the need for bereavement leave.</p>

    <h3>2.7. Public Holiday Leave</h3>
    <p>Employees are entitled to all official public holidays as per the government of the respective location. If an employee works on a public holiday, they will be compensated with time off in lieu or overtime pay, as per company policy.</p>

    <h3>2.8. Unpaid Leave</h3>
    <p>Employees can request unpaid leave if they have exhausted all other paid leave options. Unpaid leave requests must be submitted in advance and are subject to manager and HR approval.</p>

    <h3>2.9. Emergency Leave</h3>
    <p>Employees can request emergency leave in cases of unforeseen events (e.g., family emergencies). Employees must inform HR and their manager as soon as possible. Emergency leave may be granted with or without pay depending on the circumstances.</p>

    <h3>2.10. Leave Encashment</h3>
    <p>Unused earned leave and casual leave may be encashed at the end of the year or upon leaving the company. Encashment is paid out based on the employee's last drawn salary.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>3. General Guidelines</h2>
    <p>All leave requests must be submitted through the company's leave management system or the prescribed form. Employees are responsible for managing their leave balance. HR will monitor leave records and notify employees when their balance is low. All leave must be approved by the employee's direct supervisor and HR. If leave is taken without approval, it will be considered unauthorized and may lead to disciplinary action.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>4. Amendments</h2>
    <p>This policy is subject to change and may be revised as per company needs or statutory requirements. Employees will be notified of any significant changes.</p>
